# Interactive Survey Form

Any project that uses forms to gather user input data must always include forms. There are various questions that users can ask in this form. The basic form layout will be created using HTML in this case, and CSS will add attractive design elements like text-decoration, text colour, background colour, text alignment, margin, and padding.
